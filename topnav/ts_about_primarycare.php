    <h2 class = "def1">Primary health care is based on caring for people rather than specific diseases. This means that 
        professionals working in general practice are generalists, dealing with a broad range of physical, psychological and 
        social problems, rather than specialists in a particular disease area.</h2>
    <h2 class = "def2">General medicine, sometimes known as internal medicine, is a field of medicine that focuses on the 
        prevention, diagnosis, and non-surgical treatment of illnesses that are connected to the internal organs.</h2>
