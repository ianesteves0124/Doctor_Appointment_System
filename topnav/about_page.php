    <p class = "obj1">One of the most priceless possessions we have is our health. 
        The need for healthcare keeps growing every year. Our population is expanding, and our average lifespan is rising. 
        At the same time, many kinds of ailments—chronic illnesses, mental problems, catastrophic traumas, 
        even pandemics—are becoming more prevalent. To address these issues and provide for their populations more 
        effectively, the majority of nations are increasing their investments on health. Caretakers put in a lot of effort 
        to look after their patients.</p> 
    <p class = "obj2">A mission that is getting harder and harder as there aren't enough medical experts 
        to handle the rising demand for care. They are frequently dispersed inequitably among regions. Furthermore, 
        they lack the resources needed to carry out their everyday duties and expand their practice or hospital. 
        We're at a standstill, some may argue. Even yet, at Doctor Appointment, we are confident that technology can 
        assist both patients and health professionals in overcoming this challenge.</p>
